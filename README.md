# Mini Leave Management System

 Problem Statement

We are building the MVP of a Leave Management System for a startup with
50 employees.\
The HR team should be able to:\
1. Add employees with details (Name, Email, Department, Joining Date).\
2. Apply, approve, and reject leave requests.\
3. Track leave balance for each employee.

Features Implemented (Part 1)

-   Add Employee (with default leave balance = 20).\
-   Apply for Leave (validations added).\
-   Approve / Reject Leave.\
-   Fetch Leave Balance per Employee.\
-   Edge Cases handled:
    -   Invalid dates (end date before start date).\
    -   Leave before joining date.\
    -   More days than available balance.\
    -   Employee not found.\
    -   Overlapping approved leaves.

Tech Stack

-   **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java)\
-   **Database**: H2 / MySQL (configurable)\
-   **Frontend**: (Future) React / Angular / Simple HTML UI
